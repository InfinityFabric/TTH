Setting up crossings for kinematics ''
Crossing equivalence: '' -> ''
External legs:
  external leg 1 is incoming, has momenta p1 and mass 0
  external leg 2 is incoming, has momenta p2 and mass 0
  external leg 3 is outgoing, has momenta p3 and mass 0
  external leg 4 is outgoing, has momenta p4 and mass 0
  external leg 5 is outgoing, has momenta p2-p4+p1-p3 and mass s34+s14+s24+s13+s23+s12
Rules to replace scalar products by kinematic invariants:
  SP(p2,p4) -> -1/2*s24
  SP(p2,p1) -> 1/2*s12
  SP(p3,p3) -> 0
  SP(p2,p3) -> -1/2*s23
  SP(p4,p4) -> 0
  SP(p1,p3) -> -1/2*s13
  SP(p4,p1) -> -1/2*s14
  SP(p2,p2) -> 0
  SP(p1,p1) -> 0
  SP(p4,p3) -> 1/2*s34
