Loaded integral family pentagon2
Loaded 2 (uncrossed) integral families
Done loading uncrossed integral families
Created auxiliary job setup_crossings
Created auxiliary job verify_permutation_symmetries for family: pentagon1
Created auxiliary job verify_permutation_symmetries for family: pentagon2
Inserted new job in queue: job(2): verify permutation symmetries of family 'pentagon2'
Inserted new job in queue: job(3): verify permutation symmetries of family 'pentagon1'
